# Car Price Prediction Project

This project aims to predict car prices using various regression algorithms, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, KNN Regressor, etc. Predictive modeling involves multiple steps beyond building and fitting a model. Here, we document the entire process, from data collection and preprocessing to model evaluation.

## Project Overview
* Dataset Selection:
  * Selected a dataset from a predictive modeling competition, considering current car market trends.

* Data Preprocessing:
  * Checked the data types of each variable.
  * Identified and handled missing values and outliers.
  * Dropped unnecessary or redundant data.
  * Finalized the columns to be used for modeling.

* Data Visualization:
  * Used various plots (barplot, boxplot, histogram, etc.) to understand data insights.
  * Analyzed trends such as the price hike starting from the year 2000 and the demand for Jeep cars.
  * Examined the impact of amenities on car production.
