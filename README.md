# Car Price Prediction Project

This project aims to predict car prices using various regression algorithms, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, KNN Regressor, etc. Predictive modeling involves multiple steps beyond building and fitting a model. Here, we document the entire process, from data collection and preprocessing to model evaluation.

## Project Overview
* Dataset Selection:
  * Selected a dataset from a predictive modeling competition, considering current car market trends.
